            <p class="bio-text"><img class="photo" src="assets/images/edHeadShot.png" alt="My mugshot">I am a software developer who lives in the Seattle area.  I am currently studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the UW coding Bootcamp.  
            I have a broad range of technical skills and I like to learn new things. I can juggle and ride a unicycle, but not at the same time. I like to hike and ride bike. I organize hikes for my friends. It is important to me to stay in shape. I am an above average rec room ping pong player. I am a follower of ancient religion called the Way.

            My last position was with a health care service organization.  My business unit supported a tobacco cessation program.  I worked as a software developer on the customer relationship management system that support the cessation program. The program was primarily driven through phone based coaching and online learning.

            <p class="bio-clearfloat">I am married to my lovely wife, Denise, and I have two adult sons.  I live in Brier Washington where you always want to observe the 
            speed limit. Brier has an infamouse speeding trap.
